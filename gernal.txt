RAFT-KV-STORE

1st week

1) Core Storage Engine
- Implemented `MemoryStore` in `store/memory.go`.
- Added in-memory data container: `map[string]string`.
- Added concurrency safety with `sync.RWMutex`:
  - `RLock` for concurrent readers.
  - `Lock` for exclusive writes/deletes.
- Added clean error handling:
  - `ErrKeyEmpty` when key is empty.
  - `ErrKeyNotFound` when key does not exist.
- Added constructor `NewMemoryStore()` to initialize map safely.

2) Storage Abstraction
- Defined `Store` interface in `store/store.go` with:
  - `Set(key, value) error`
  - `Get(key) (string, error)`
  - `Delete(key) error`
- This allows API and higher layers to depend on behavior, not concrete type.

3) HTTP Server Layer
- Implemented REST handlers:
  - `PUT /set`
  - `GET /get?key=...`
  - `DELETE /delete?key=...`
- Implemented JSON request parsing and JSON responses.
- Added status code handling:
  - `400` bad request/input
  - `404` key not found
  - `500` internal error
- Wired store into API through interface dependency.

4) Logging and Operational Improvements
- Added reusable logger in `utils/logger.go`.
- Added request logging with:
  - HTTP method
  - path
  - response status
  - request latency
- Added request ID middleware and response header `X-Request-ID`.
- Added panic recovery middleware so panics return JSON `500` instead of crashing server.

5) Scalability-Oriented Refactor
- Added `config` layer in `config/config.go`.
  - Reads `KVSTORE_PORT`, fallback `PORT`, default `8080`.
- Refactored route setup into `api.NewRouter(handler)`.
- Simplified `main.go` to wiring only (config + logger + store + router + server).
- Added `store.NewDefaultStore()` provider function for future store swap.
  - Current default: `MemoryStore`.
  - Future target: `RaftStore` / replicated store without changing API code.

6) Testing and Validation
- Added unit test for basic behavior (`Set/Get/Delete`).
- Added concurrency stress tests:
  - mixed concurrent Set/Get/Delete
  - heavy concurrent read tests
  - deadlock timeout guard
- Added benchmarks for write and read performance.
- Ran tests with race detector to validate synchronization behavior.

7) Tooling and Environment Fixes
- Resolved package compile issue in `utils/logger.go` by adding package declaration.
- Installed and configured MinGW-w64 compiler for race detection on Windows.
- Updated Go C toolchain config (`CC`, `CXX`) and validated `go test -race ./...`.

8) Documentation
- Wrote a complete README with:
  - project overview
  - features
  - architecture diagrams (current + future raft)
  - API usage examples
  - run/test instructions
  - integration test notes
  - roadmap and demo checklist
